    "The project is an Analysis of paleo-present climate data. The following steps need to be done in order to carry out it succesfully:\n",
    "- Analyse CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs â€“ present.\n",
    "- Examine one other (paleo/modern) features (e.g. CH4 or polar ice-coverage).\n",
    "- Examine Irish context:\n",
    "    - Climate change signals: (see Maynooth study: The emergence of a climate change signal in long-term Irish meteorological observations - ScienceDirect)\n",
    "- Fuse and analyse data from various data sources and format fused data set as a pandas dataframe and export to csv and json formats.\n",
    "- For all of the above variables, analyse the data, the trends and the relationships between them (temporal leads/lags/frequency analysis).\n",
    "- Predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades (synthesise data) and compare to published climate models if atmospheric CO2 trends continue.\n",
    "- Comment on accelerated warming based on very latest features (e.g. temperature/polar-ice- coverage).\n"
